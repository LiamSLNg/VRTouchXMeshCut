# VRTouchXMeshCut

The main file that has the VR Haptic Mesh Cut is found in the scene called "VR HMC".

If one doesn't have access to a Meta Quest 2, but has a 3D Systems Touch X then use the scene called Haptic Mesh Cut.

Other scenes are experimental to test out the features of the Vanco Mesh Deformation plugin and if they are viable with the Haptics Direct plugin.
